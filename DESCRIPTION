Description: The 'pathtrackr' package allows for automated video tracking of an
    animal's movement. Using a video file (for machines with FFmpeg installed) or a
    series of still frame jpegs as inputs, tracking functions automatically record
    the position of the animal in each frame and return a list of data and sumamry
    statistics. Also included are plotting and disgnostic functions.
