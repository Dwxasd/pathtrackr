Overview
--------

Visualising and analysing animal movement patterns is essenial to many behavioural studies. While commercial options exist for analysing animal movement via video, the cost of these is often prohibitive. To meet the need for an efficient and cost-effective video tracking and analysis tool, we have developed the 'pathtrackr' package. The 'pathtrackr' package allows for an automated and consolidated workflow, from video input to statistical output of an animal's movement. The tracking functions work across a variety of visual contexts, including heterogenous backgrounds and variable lighting, and can deal with small amounts of localised background movement. We also include diagnostic tools in the package for troubleshooting. Future updates will include the ability to track multiple animals simultaneously, extending the functionality to track animal interactions.

Installation
------------

You can install *pathtrackr* directly from within R using the *install\_github()* function from the *devtools* package:

``` r
install_github("aharmer/pathtrackr")
```

Alternativley, you can download and install the source package from the [pathtrackr](https://aharmer.github.io/pathtrackr/) page.
